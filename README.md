# Planet Coaster 2 — Real-Time Co-op Research

> **Project status — 2026-10-21:** Early feasibility and modding research. **No playable co-op mod, no validated programmatic scenery placement, and no two-client synchronization.**

We are investigating how two players might build in the same **Planet Coaster 2** park in real time. The immediate goal is **one confirmed, persistent scenery edit**, not guests, rides, terrain, economy or full simulation synchronization.

## Progress at a glance

| Milestone | Current evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Custom Lua mod loads | **Verified in PC2:** ACSE 0.729 loads the diagnostic mod; ForgeUtils 2.7.0's hook manager can be required. |
| ACSE world component survives park transition | **Verified:** minimal component with `Shutdown()` deactivates in `startscreenglobe` and is recreated in `tropicalworld` (diagnostic 005). |
| Editor and undo API visible in the park | **Verified:** diagnostic 006 found `worldAPIs.editors`, `CreateUndoOperationsHierarchy`, and four `api.undo` methods as functions in `tropicalworld`. **Presence checks only.** |
| Create an undo hierarchy | **Next experiment — diagnostic 007. Not yet run.** |
| Create, commit, save and reload a scenery part | **Not verified.** |
| Send a scenery edit between two game clients | **Not implemented or tested.** |

The successful 005/006 logs came from a **copied test installation launched outside Sandboxie**. They establish PC2 behavior in that copied installation, **not** validation of the fully sandboxed launch path. A separate Sandboxie setup is documented below. See the [runtime test record](docs/testing/RUNTIME_TESTS.md).

## What we know — and what we do not

PC2's inspected editor Lua provides a **static** scenery path through `CreateNewPart`, preview, and a deferred commit. In a running PC2 park, our own diagnostic confirmed that the editor API and undo method names are accessible. **We have not yet invoked `CreateUndoOperationsHierarchy()` from our mod**, nor demonstrated a created scenery part surviving save/reload. The next experiment is intentionally read-only apart from constructing an empty hierarchy; it will not commit any edits.

An earlier custom world component caused a crash during the menu-to-park transition. A later minimal component that included `Shutdown()` passed that transition; because other probes were removed at the same time, **we cannot attribute the fix solely to `Shutdown()`**. Full history: [runtime tests](docs/testing/RUNTIME_TESTS.md).

## Compatibility and safety

The runtime logs identify **PC2 1.11.4.1011357**, **ACSE 0.729**, **ForgeUtils 2.7.0** and **ACSEDebug 0.014**. The cross-game ACSEDebug package captured log messages, but its **debug GUI and native helpers are not verified safe in PC2**; avoid the GUI. The exact package provenance should not be inferred from the logs.

Use only backed-up, disposable installs and test parks. The [Sandboxie notes](docs/ISOLATED-INSTALLATION.md) describe a past startup compatibility setting, `UnstrippedToken=y`, which **reduces token isolation**. It does not prove a Denuvo defect or establish full cloud/save isolation. Do not use the old diagnostic launcher without checking its mod-restoration side effects.
